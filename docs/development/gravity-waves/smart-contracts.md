# Gravity Waves (Smart Contracts)

## What are Gravity Waves?

**Gravity Waves**, often referred to as *'smart contracts'* on other blockchains, are the executable code that interprets the instructions sent inside of each transaction on GravityChain. They are deployed directly into the Gravity Node as a Kotlin file which publishes as On-Chain Contract. Smart Contracts are the core building blocks of the network and handle everything from sending tokens between wallets, to accepting votes of a DAOs, to tracking ownership of NFTs.
