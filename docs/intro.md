# Introduction to Gravity Chain

## What is Gravity Chain?

Gravity is worlds first mobile powered open source blockchain infrastructure that can enable mining on mobile using unique consensus protocol called **Proof of Participation(PoP)**.

## Why Gravity exists?

With the advent of blockchains around the world we have seen many different strategies when it comes to consensus mechanisms and the architectures using them. These have excited the developers around the world to build some amazing decentralized products. Unfortunately, these have also brought some common problems like energy consumption, high gas fee, complexity barriers in mining, insecurity, mistrust and development challenges.

> Gravity solves these challenges by going mobile first approach. With mobiles always connected to the network and having massive computation and storage capabilities, Gravity is easily able to distribute the computation among **Gravity Mobile Miners** with least energy consumption.

## Who are Gravity Mobile Miners?
Anyone with a [**Gravity Wallet app**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chain.gravity.app&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) installed on their phone can work as a miner. Gravity Miners help in decentralising the process of block mining with providing partial computation of the block verification. Instead in traditional consensus protocols where a miner(or a pool) having heavy computation machine tries to solve multiple problems at their end, with Proof of Participation, a single problem is distributed to multiple mobile miners. 

## What are GRTs?
A GRT is the name of GravityChains's native token, which can be passed to nodes in a Gravity Node in exchange for running an on-chain program or validating its output. The system may perform micropayments of fractional GRTs, which are called **Gravitons**. They are named under the concept of [**Graviton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton) as per quantum gravity theory. A Graviton has a value of 0.000000001 GRT.
