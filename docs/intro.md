# Introduction to Gravity Chain

## What is Gravity Chain?

Gravity is world's first mobile powered open source blockchain infrastructure that can enable mining on mobile using unique consensus protocol called **Proof of Participation(PoP)**.

## Why Gravity exists?

Mobile-based decentralized blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with each other and with the world around us. With the increasing ubiquity of smartphones and other mobile devices, it makes sense to harness the power of blockchain technology in a way that is accessible and convenient for users on the go.

One of the biggest advantages of decentralized blockchain technology is its ability to create a more secure and transparent system for conducting transactions and sharing information. By using cryptographic techniques to verify transactions and maintain a distributed ledger, decentralized blockchain networks can provide a secure and tamper-proof way of storing and sharing data. This can be especially beneficial for financial transactions, where the ability to ensure the security and integrity of data is crucial.

Another advantage of mobile-based decentralized blockchain technology is its potential to enable greater participation and inclusion in the global economy. By providing individuals with access to a decentralized network, mobile-based blockchain technology can enable individuals and communities who may not have had access to traditional financial services to participate in the global economy. This can help to reduce inequality and promote financial inclusion, particularly in developing countries.

Additionally, mobile-based decentralized blockchain technology has the potential to improve the efficiency and speed of transactions. By removing the need for intermediaries and central authorities, decentralized blockchain networks can enable transactions to be conducted more quickly and with lower transaction fees. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses and individuals who may not have access to traditional financial services.

Overall, the development of mobile-based decentralized blockchain technology has the potential to provide significant benefits for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. By enabling greater security, transparency, participation, and efficiency, mobile-based decentralized blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with each other and with the world around us.

> With mobiles always connected to the network and having massive computation and storage capabilities, Gravity is easily able to distribute the computation among **Gravity Mobile Miners** with least energy consumption.

## Who are Gravity Mobile Miners?
The [**Gravity Wallet app**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chain.gravity.app&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1)  allows users to participate in the process of block mining as miners. This decentralized approach to block mining is made possible through the use of the Proof of Participation consensus protocol, which distributes a single computational problem among multiple mobile miners. This allows individuals with limited computational resources, such as those using mobile devices, to contribute to the mining process and help to maintain the security and integrity of the blockchain network. By decentralizing the mining process in this way, the Gravity Wallet app helps to make the blockchain more accessible and inclusive.

## What are GRTs?
A GRT is the name of GravityChains's native token, which can be passed to nodes in a Gravity Node in exchange for running an on-chain program or validating its output. The system may perform micropayments of fractional GRTs, which are called **Gravitons**. They are named under the concept of [**Graviton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton) as per quantum gravity theory. A Graviton has a value of 0.000000001 GRT.
